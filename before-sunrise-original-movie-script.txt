INT. TRAIN - AFTERNOON

1

The Eurail rolls along. Inside, passengers sleep, read, and
stare out the windows. A few walk up and down the aisles.
CELINE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is curled up in
her seat reading Georges Bataill’s Story of the Eye.
Strikingly attractive, she plays it down by wearing no
makeup, a loose-fitting vintage dress, and flat shoes. She
continues reading while taking an occasional bite of a
chocolate bar. Sitting four rows back and on the other side
of the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in Klaus
Kinski’s memoir, All I Need Is Love. Casually good looking
but a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt
mode. Suddenly a couple, two fortyish types who have been
arguing semiquietly in the seat behind Celine, start yelling
at each other in German. The WIFE takes a swipe at the
newspaper the HUSBAND has been screening him behind.
WIFE
Will you put down that damn
newspaper and listen to me?
HUSBAND
What’ve I been doing the last
thirty minutes? Would you shut up
for Chrissake?
WIFE
You shut up! How dare you tell me
to shut up! It’s the same damn
thing all over again! I can’t
believe -HUSBAND
I said shut up! I’m putting down
my newspaper and telling you to
shut up.
Celine suddenly gets up, grabs her bag, and starts looking
for another seat. A few rows back, she finds a seat across
the aisle from Jesse. Before sitting down, they make brief
eye contact and kind of shake their heads and smile at the
tension. Just as she settles in and goes back to her book,
the wife gets up and storms down the aisle. Jesse and Celine
follow her with their eyes, and as she passes them, they find
they are looking right at each other. He makes a funny “uhoh” face.

2.
JESSE
Do you have any idea what they’re
arguing about? Do you speak
English?
CELINE
Yes. But no, I don’t know. My
German is not that good.
(a beat)
Have you ever heard that as couples
get older they lose their ability
to hear each other?
Really?

JESSE

CELINE
Supposedly men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds and
women eventually lose hearing on
the low end. I guess they sort of
nullify each other or something.
JESSE
Must be nature’s way of allowing
couples to grow old together and
not kill each other, I guess.
There’s a slightly awkward moment where they don’t know if
they should continue talking or not. She glances back down
at her book but he keeps looking at her.
JESSE (CONT’D)
What are you reading?
She holds up the book so he can see what it is.
CELINE
How about you?
He shows her what he’s reading. Neither has much to say
about the other’s reading material.
CELINE (CONT’D)
There are so many weird people on
the train, no? Last week on my way
to Budapest I was sitting and
talking with four other people in
the lounge car and it turned out
that three of them had killed
people.
No way.

JESSE

3.
CELINE
Really. One was a war veteran, one
had murdered her boyfriend, and
another had caused a bad car wreck.
JESSE
So you were the only one who hadn’t
killed anyone?
CELINE
No, I was one of them.
do you think?

Which one

She laughs and he slowly joins her.
JESSE
I know what you mean. I’ve met
some weirdos. There was this
British guy sitting across from me
the other day who kept throwing his
body against the back of his chair,
yelling about how we should all
join together and stop the train.
He was saying, “Everybody, now, we
can stop technology. All
together...”
CELINE
So what happened?
He demonstrates by throwing his body against his seat.
JESSE
And you know, me and a few others
tried for a while, but we couldn’t
stop technology.
The wife who stormed away earlier suddenly comes back and the
argument resumes, right in front of them.
JESSE (CONT’D)
I was thinking about going to the
lounge car sometimes soon. You
wanna go?
We better.

CELINE

They get up and walk to the door of their car. He pushes the
DOOR OPEN button, and as the door opens, he extends his hand
toward her.

4.
JESSE
Oh, I’m Jesse. It’s James,
actually, but my whole life
everyone’s called me Jesse.
CELINE
So it’s Jesse James?
JESSE
No, just Jesse.
Celine.

CELINE

They proceed through the door and Celine pushes the DOOR OPEN
button to enter the next car. There is some confusion as to
who is opening the door for whom before Celine proceeds and
jesse follows her toward the lounge car.
2

INT. LOUNGE CAR - AFTERNOON
They sit at a table, eating chips and taking an occasional
swig from a drink.
JESSE
So how do you speak such good
English?
CELINE
I went to school for a summer in
Los Angeles and I’ve spent some
time in London. How do you speak
such good English?
JESSE
I’m American.
CELINE
I know. It’s a joke. I knew you
were American, and, of course, you
don’t speak any other language.
JESSE
Yeah, yeah, I’m the dumb, vulgar
American who has no culture. But I
tried. I want you to know I took
four years of French. I tried, I
was ready. When I was in Paris, I
was standing in line at the metro
going, “Un billet, s’il vous plâit.
(MORE)

2

5.
JESSE (CONT'D)
Un billet, s’il vous plâit.” And
then I got up to the window, I
looked up at the lady and blanked
out. “Uh, uh, I need a ticket for
the subway.” No more French for
me.
(a beat)
So where are you headed?
CELINE
Back to Paris. My class starts
next week.
JESSE
Where do you go to school?
CELINE
La Sorbonne. You know?
Sure.

JESSE
But you were in Budapest?

CELINE
Yeah, I was visiting my
grandmother.
JESSE
How is she?
CELINE
Okay. How about you - where are
you going?
Vienna.

JESSE

CELINE
What’s there?
JESSE
I don’t know. I’m flying out of
there tomorrow morning.
CELINE
Are you on a holiday?
JESSE
I don’t know what I’m on. I’ve
just been traveling around the last
two or three weeks.
CELINE
Were you visiting friends, or just
going around on your own?

6.
JESSE
I visited a friend in Madrid for a
while, but mostly I’ve just been...
(new thought)
I got one of those Eurail passes,
and you know what’s fascinating
about traveling around? You spend
all this time trying to reach your
destination, you get there, you
look around, it’s never exactly
what you’d hoped, you head off
somewhere else, and hope for
something better.
CELINE
It’s like getting ready for a
party, getting there, and falling
asleep. That’s why when I’m
traveling I kind of force myself
not to expect anything from
anywhere or anyone. And then,
whatever happens is a surprise.
The most insignificant thing can
become an endless subject of
interest, no?
JESSE
That’s what I like about traveling you can sit down, maybe talk to
someone interesting, see something
beautiful, read a good book, and
that’s enough to qualify a good
day. You do that at home and
everyone thinks you’re a bum.
CELINE
I like that though. But it’s like
my favorite American writers. They
describe everything you wouldn’t
want to live through, and yet you
cannot stop reading of this
exciting, boring life.
JESSE
So what do you study?
CELINE
Literature. But I haven’t decided
yet what I really want to do.
JESSE
Do you want to write?

7.
CELINE
Yeah, but...
(new thought)
I kind of had this obsession a few
years ago about creating a new form
of expression. It was of course an
abstract and lost quest, but I was
feeling all art forms seemed used
up. I was especially rejecting
words. They seemed so rusted and
dirty. And they’ve been used for
such evil ends. Sometimes, you
know, language is so limited. It’s
like...if you think about it...
She holds her hands out fairly wide and round.
CELINE (CONT’D)
This is an individual’s mental
experience and perception and...
She holds her hands together and forms a small circle.
CELINE (CONT’D)
This is how much can be expressed
through language. We just don’t
have words for so many of the
impressions we have.
She parts her hands and gestures to the large outer circle.
CELINE (CONT’D)
So most of our life we will never
be able to express to anyone.
They sit there for an extended moment, neither sure what to
say next. Suddenly Jesse smiles and jokingly starts to get
up.
JESSE
So I guess...that’s it - it’s been
nice not communicating with you.
They both laugh.
JESSE (CONT’D)
Really, though, I basically agree
with you, and maybe it’s a sad face
of life, but I think it doesn’t
bother me that much. Maybe I’m
wrong about this, but I think that
lack of communication frustrates
women more than men.

8.
CELINE
Yes, because men are perfectly
content to sit in front of TV all
day drinking beer and watching
sports.
JESSE
Yeah, that’s true, but have you
ever done that? I did it once with
a friend of mine. Drank some beer,
had some chips, and watched a
couple of games. It was the first
time in years I literally jumped
for joy. On some level it’s
sticking your head in the sand, but
on another I think it must serve
some tribal purpose.
CELINE
I actually agree with you. I kind
of like sports. It’s one of these
few times when men are treated like
stupid objects...I’m joking. So
you haven’t told me what you do.
Are you still in school?
JESSE
Nah, I never graduated from
college.
CELINE
Are you working?
JESSE
I have a stupid job like everyone
else.
CELINE
Is it boring? You’re not happy?
JESSE
No, it’s a decent job. I don’t get
paid that much. I don’t do that
much.
CELINE
So what is the job?
JESSE
I write for a newspaper, the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, and pretty
much get to do what I want there
creatively, so it’s okay.

9.
CELINE
So you write?
Kinda.

JESSE

CELINE
So has this trip been good for you?
JESSE
Yeah. I mean, on one level, it
sucked, but sitting on a train and
staring out the window for days on
end has actually been kind of
great.
CELINE
What do you mean?
JESSE
I’ve had an idea I probably would
never have had otherwise. Can I
tell you about it?
Yes.

CELINE

JESSE
Some friends of mine are these
cable access producers - you know,
anyone can produce a program, and
they have to show it. I got really
jazzed about it. I imagined a show
I want to produce that would last
an entire year, twenty-four hours a
day. I want to get 365 different
video producers around the world to
each make their own twenty-fourhour-long document of real time,
capturing life around them just as
it is lived. So it’d be people
waking up, taking a long shower,
getting a cup of coffee and reading
the paper for twenty minutes, a
long drive to work.
CELINE
You mean all those boring, mundane
things everyone has to do every day
of their life?
JESSE
I was going to say the poetry of
day-to-day life.
(MORE)

10.
JESSE (CONT'D)
I mean, Why is your dog so great
just for sleeping in the sun? And
a guy getting money out of a bank
machine is a moron?
CELINE
So you can put on the TV at any
time of the day and see what other
people are doing at the same time.
Right.

JESSE
It’s like parallel lives.

CELINE
That’s great. I once lived in a
big apartment I was sharing with
friends, and we could see ten other
apartments from the window. I
would cut down the light, sit at
the window, and watch them sitting
on a couch doing nothing. It was
fascinating.
JESSE
That’s the trick. Life is not
really about drama. That we all do
the same shit and going to some
market in Arabia is the same as
going to Kmart in Miami. People
believe they are missing out, that
everyone else has this great and
exciting life and they don’t. I
mean, we all have to get dressed,
feed the kids, get our driver’s
licence renewed, look up what time
the afternoon matinee starts, lose
ourselves in entertainment, lose
ourselves in sex, routine, getting
a little too drunk, buying a
present for someone you don’t like
very much - you feel guilty about
not liking them, so you spend a
little too much money.
CELINE
So, it’s like a National Geographic
program on people.
Exactly.

JESSE

11.
CELINE
I can see it: twenty-four boring
hours and a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.
JESSE
Exactly. And that would be an
exciting episode. Maybe you and
your friends can do one of those
episodes from Paris. The key to
making this work would be in the
distribution. Getting the tapes
from town to town on time...But it
would play continuously twenty-four
hours for a year on stations around
the world.
The waiter finally arrives and gives them the menus.

INT. LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
Some time has passed. They have dirty dishes in front of
them. They seem more relaxed with each other, more
forthright, less self-conscious, a little more intimate.
CELINE
My parents have never really spoken
of the possibility of my falling in
love or getting married or having
children. Even as a little girl,
they wanted me to think about a
future career as a TV newscaster,
or a dentist, or something like
that.
JESSE
(smiles)
Anchorwoman...
CELINE
Yeah, I’d say to my dad I wanted to
be a writer and he’d say
journalist. I’d say I wanted to
have a refuge for stray cats and
he’d say veterinarian. I’d say I
wanted to be an actress and he’d
say TV newscaster. It was this
constant conversion of my fanciful
ambitions into practical
moneymaking ventures.

3

12.
JESSE
Parents just want you to have a
nice career so they can tell their
friends something interesting.
(a beat)
I musta had a pretty decent
bullshit detector when I was a kid.
I always knew when they were lying
to me. By the time I was in
highschool, I was dead set on
listening to what everyone thought
I should be doing with my life and
then almost systematically doing
the opposite. They weren’t really
mean about it. All their typical
ambitions sounded so mediocre.
CELINE
If you have parents that never
fully contradict anything you want
to do and are basically nice and
supportive, it makes it harder to
officially complain. Even when
they are wrong. It’s this passiveaggressive shit. I can’t stand it.
Jesse takes a swig of water and chews some ice.
JESSE
Yeah, but despite plenty of
bullshit, I still remember being a
kid as a magical time.
(a beat)
I remember my mom explaining death
to me, and telling me that my greatgrandmother in Florida had died.
The whole family had just visited
them. I must have been three,
three and a half years old.
Anyway, I was playing in the
backyard a day or so later, and my
sister had taught me how to spray
the garden hose into the sun and
see a rainbow. Well, I was
spraying it and through the mist I
could see my great-grandmother
standing there, just kind of
smiling, looking at me. I just
held the hose in that position for
a long time and looked at her.
Finally, I took my thumb off the
nozzle, let the hose go, and she
disappeared.
(MORE)

13.
JESSE (CONT'D)
My parents gave me this rap about
how I imagined it and how when
people die you never see them
again. But, I knew what I had
seen, and even though I’ve never
seen anything like that since, I’ve
never really been very afraid of
death.
CELINE
That’s good you can have that
attitude toward death. I think I
am afraid of death twenty-four
hours a day. That’s why I’m on the
train. I could have flown to
Paris. I’m just afraid of flying.
Even though statistics say it’s
safer, I can’t help it. When I’m
sitting in a plane, I already can
see an explosion, me falling
through the clouds. I’m so afraid
of the few seconds of consciousness
before dying. I mean, when you
know for sure you’re gonna die. I
can’t help anticipating the worst.
Like, I was in the park with this
friend of mine. There were little
kids playing around. This mother
was throwing her child up in the
air. My friend was smiling and
thought it was so wonderful, and
all I could think of was her
dropping it. I could already see
all the blood on the ground. The
big panic, the mother crying...I
think like this all the time. It’s
exhausting.
We see out the window that the train is pulling into Vienna.
CELINE (CONT’D)
This is Vienna. You get off here,
no?
JESSE
Drag. I wish I would have met you
earlier. I really like talking to
you.
CELINE
It was really nice talking to you,
too.

14.
JESSE
I’ve hardly talked to anyone in
weeks.
4

EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

4

The train comes to a final stop. The doors open and soon
everyone is unboarding and boarding.
5

INT. LOUNGE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
With a slight smile, Jesse looks intensely at Celine.
JESSE
I have an admittedly insane
thought. If I don’t ask you this,
it’ll be one of those things that
will haunt me forever.
What?

CELINE

He just looks at her a little nervously and can’t say it.
She is truly intrigued and a little excited at what he’s
struggling with.
What?

CELINE (CONT’D)

JESSE
I want to keep talking with you. I
mean, I have no idea what your
situation is, but I feel some kind
of...connection.
CELINE
Yeah, me too.
JESSE
So how about this. Okay, good...I
want you to get off her in Vienna
with me. We can check out the
town.
She smiles at the thought but is not totally sure.
CELINE
So what would we do?

5

15.
JESSE
I don’t know. All I know is I’m
getting on this Austria Airlines
flight at nine-thirty tomorrow
morning and I can’t really afford a
hotel and we’ll probably just
wander around all night. If I turn
out to be a psycho, you can bail
out anytime and get back on the
next train, right?
She’s still thinking but doesn’t respond.
JESSE (CONT’D)
Think of it like this. Jump ahead
ten, twenty years. Your marriage
just doesn’t have that same energy
anymore. You start to blame your
husband. You think of all the guys
you’ve met and all the ones you
never pursued and how things might
have been different if you’d just
picked up with one of them. Well,
I’m one of them. You can consider
this traveling back in time, to see
what you are missing. See, this is
really a big favor to both you and
your future husband - it’s a chance
to see how you really haven’t
missed anything. That I’m just as
boring and unmotivated as he is,
hopefully more.
She smiles a little, ponders the situation, and then just
stands up.
CELINE
I’m not sure if I got all the
story, but let me get my bag.
6

EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

He gets off the train with his bags and starts walking, not
fully aware she’s not right behind him. She has hesitated
slightly and pauses at the top of the stairs. After glancing
back briefly, she looks ahead and proceeds with confidence.
7

INT. TRAIN STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
Inside the busy train station lobby, they stop at a change
machine and exchange currency.

She opens a

CELINE
You know what this makes me think
of?
What?

JESSE

CELINE
All those people you briefly
intersect with, maybe make eye
contact with, and then pass by.
JESSE
Yes, we could have done that.
it’s like...

Now

CELINE
No matter what happens, we have
met.
Jesse just smiles and offers up his open hand. She touches
her hand to his and there is a slow clasp and a slight pull
toward one another.
JESSE
That we have.
9

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
Walking along in silence, they both are observing what is
around them and eventually look back at each other. Fully
realizing they are now committed to one another in some
strange way, there is an awkward silence.
CELINE
It’s such a strange feeling. When
we were talking on the train, it’s
like we were in public - there were
people around us. Now that we’re
actually walking around Vienna,
it’s like we are all alone.
JESSE
I know. It feels a little awkward.
I’m not sure what we should be
doing.
He puts his hand on her shoulder and looks right at her.

9

17.
JESSE (CONT’D)
But this is okay, though, right?
CELINE
Yes, this is great. Let’s go to
some places. Look at your little
book.
He pulls out a little pamphlet/map and starts looking through
it.
JESSE
Good. Right. We’re in Vienna and
we’re going to go places.
Just then two local passersby, TEX and KARL, walk past them.
Jesse stops them.
Excuse me.

JESSE (CONT’D)
Sprechen Sie English?

KARL
Yah, of course.
TEX
Perhaps you speak German for a
change?
What?

JESSE

TEX
It was a joke.
Tex looks over at Karl, both in on it.
JESSE
We just got into Vienna and we’re
looking for something fun to do...
CELINE
Yeah, are there any museums we
should see or anything?
TEX
Museums are not exactly fun these
days.
Karl looks at his watch.
KARL
And they are all closing right now,
anyway. How long are you going to
be here?

18.
JESSE
Just tonight.
TEX
Why did you come to Vienna?
could you be expecting?

What

CELINE
We’re on our honeymoon...
JESSE
Yeah, she’s pregnant, so we decided
to go ahead and get married.
TEX
I don’t believe you.
very good at lying.

You are not

Celine and Jesse laugh while Tex and Karl talk amongst
themselves in German.
TEX (CONT’D)
Do you have the fliers?
KARL
Yeah, I’ll give them one.
Karl digs in his pocket and hands a flier to them.
TEX
This is a play we’re both in we’d
like you to come to.
CELINE
So you are actors?
TEX
Not professional actors, but parttime for fun.
KARL
It’s a play about a cow, and an
Indian searching for it. It also
has politicians, Mexicans,
Russians...
JESSE
You have a real cow onstage?
TEX
Not a real cow.

It’s an actor in a

KARL
And he’s the cow.
TEX
Yes, I’m the cow.

But it’s a weird

KARL
The cow has a disease.
TEX
She’s acting a bit strange...acting
like a dog. If someone throws a
stick, she fetches it. She also
smokes, with her hoofs.
He demonstrates how one would smoke with a hoof instead of a
hand. Karl points to the bottom of the flier.
KARL
The address is on the flier.
in the second district...

It’s

TEX
Near the Prater...
KARL
Yes, the place with the big Ferris
wheel.
TEX
The big wheel everybody knows...
KARL
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.
JESSE
So what’s the name of this play?
KARL
It translates as...
BOTH
“Bring Me the Horns of Wilmington’s
Cow.”
JESSE
Sounds great.
Cool.

CELINE

20.
Tex puts his index finger up by his head as everyone begins
to walk away.
TEX
I am the cow...and you will be
there?
JESSE
We’ll try to make it.
10

EXT. BETWEEN THE MUSEUMS - DAY

10

They sit on a bench near a statue, looking up at the historic
buildings and surroundings.
JESSE
Look at this - it’s beautiful. I
mean, could you imagine an American
architect saying, “Hey, Bob, I’ve
got an idea. Why don’t we put a
giant angel on top of this building
just for people to have something
beautiful to look at.” It might
start out like that, but before too
long it’d be, “Sorry, Hank, boss
said nix on the giant angel. He’s
thinking more along the lines of a
flagpole.”
CELINE
Americans always think Europe is
perfect. But such beauty and
history can be really oppressive.
It reduces the individual to
nothing. It just reminds you all
the time you are just a little
speck in a long history, where in
America you feel like you could be
making history. That’s why I liked
Los Angeles because it is so...
Ugly?

JESSE

CELINE
No, I was going to say “neutral.”
It’s like looking at a blank
canvas.
(a beat)
(MORE)

21.
CELINE (CONT'D)
I think people go to places like
Venice on their honeymoon to make
sure they are not going to fight
for the first two weeks of their
marriage because they’ll be too
busy looking around at all the
beautiful things. That’s what
people call a romantic place somewhere where the prettiness with
contain your primary violent
instinct. A real good honeymoon
spot would be like somewhere in New
Jersey.
11

EXT. TRAM STATION - DAY

11

They come down the escalator and board a tram.
12

INT. TRAM - DAY

12

They are sitting in the tram and observing everything going
by.
JESSE
Okay, Q&A time. We’ve known each
other for a little while now, we’re
stuck with each other, we can ask
each other a few, you know, direct
questions.
CELINE
So we ask each other questions?
JESSE
And you have to answer one hundred
percent honestly.
Of course.

CELINE

Celine picks up on the game he is talking about.
JESSE
First question. Describe your
first sexual feelings toward
someone.
CELINE
Well, let me think...Jean-Marc
Fleury.

22.
JESSE
Jean-Marc Fleury?
CELINE
We were at this summer camp
together and he was a swimmer. He
had that bleached-out, chlorine
hair and green eyes, and to improve
his times, he’d shave the hair off
his legs and arms. So he was like
this gorgeous dolphin. My friend
Emma had a big crush on him, and
one day I was cutting across the
field on my way back to my room, he
came walking up beside me. I told
him he should ask Emma out because
she had a big crush on him, and he
said, “That’s too bad, because I
have a big crush on you.” And it
really scared the hell out of me
because I thought he was so fine.
He officially asked me out on a
date but I pretended that I didn’t
like him because I was afraid of
what I might do. But I went to a
swim competition and watched him
swimming around. He was so sexy.
At the end of the summer we sort of
wrote these little declarations of
love to each other and said we
would keep writing and for sure
meet again soon.
Did you?

JESSE

CELINE
Of course not.
JESSE
I think then this is the
appropriate time to tell you I
happen to be an excellent swimmer.
CELINE
Okay, I’ll make a note, but it’s my
turn to ask a question. Have you
ever been in love?
He thinks for a bit and then starts in.
JESSE
Yes. Okay, next question.
you think is you --

What do

23.

Wait a minute. We can give on-word
answers?
Why not?

JESSE

CELINE
After I went into such detail about
my first sexual feelings?
JESSE
But there’s a big difference
between those two things. I could
tell you all about my first sexual
feelings, no big deal. What if I
asked you about love?
CELINE
I would have lied, but at least I
would’ve made a great story.
JESSE
See. The whole concept of love is
much more complex. Love’s like God
or something: It’s everywhere...I
see it, I feel it, but I don’t know
if another person is going to hand
it to me.
CELINE
Unfortunately, I know what you
mean.
JESSE
For what it’s worth, my first
sexual feelings were experienced
through an obsessive relationship
with Miss July, 1978. You know
Playboy?
Yes.

CELINE

JESSE
Okay, name something that really
pisses you off.
CELINE
Oh, gosh, everything pisses me off.
Like what?

JESSE

CELINE
I hate being told by strange men to
smile, just to make them feel
better about their stupid lives. I
hate that three hundred kilometers
away a war is going on. People are
dying. And nobody knows what to do
about it. I hate how the media
tries to control our minds. It’s a
new form of very subtle fascism.
And I hate in a foreign country
each time I wear black or lose my
temper or express an opinion about
anything, everyone always goes:
“Oh, it’s so French, it’s so cute.”
Oh, I hate that.
They both laugh a bit at her becoming riled up so quickly.
She calms down and asks him a question.
CELINE (CONT’D)
It’s my turn now. So what’s a
problem for you?
JESSE
You, probably.
Huh?

CELINE

JESSE
No, really, I had a thought about a
week ago that’s kind of a problem.
CELINE
What is it?
JESSE
Do you believe in reincarnation?
CELINE
On some level it’s interesting.
JESSE
Yeah. It seems like a lot of
people are talking about past lives
and all that. And even if you
don’t believe in that in a specific
way, most people have some notion
of an eternal soul, right? Anyway,
my thought was, if we all have our
origins at the beginning of human
history in some way, where did all
the current souls come from?
(MORE)

25.
JESSE (CONT'D)
The earth’s population fifty
thousand years ago was not even a
million people. Ten thousand years
ago, it was only a few million.
Now, the earth’s population is
between five and six billion.
That’s about a five-thousand-to-one
split of each soul in just the last
fifty thousand years, which is just
a blip in the earth’s time. At
best, we’re just a tiny fraction of
a soul. Is that why we all feel so
scattered?
CELINE
So, that’s a problem?
JESSE
I know, it’s kind of a scattered
thought, which is all the more
reason it makes sense.

any of her stuff. I think it’s
kind of folksy, lyrical stuff.
Jesse points across the store.

26.
JESSE
Lets’ see if that listening booth
works.
CELINE
Let’s try it.
They walk over to the booth and enter. She takes the album
out and puts it on the turntable. As the music starts they
both kind of lean against opposite walls in the small glass
booth and concentrate on the song.
SONG
There’s a wind that blows in from the north
And it says that loving takes its course
Come here, come here
No, I’m not impossible to touch
I have never wanted you so much
Come here.

Come here...

They glance subtly up at each other but usually not when the
other is looking. The song makes both of them a little
nervous as it brings out a shyness about the uncertainty of
their relationship at that point.

Inside, they wander around looking at the mostly identical
crosses.

27.
CELINE
Yes. There was this little old man
who talked to us. He was the
groundskeeper. Almost everyone
buried here washed up on the bank
where the Danube curves away.
JESSE
How old are these?
CELINE
Around the beginning of the century
or so. It’s called Cemetery of the
No Name because they often didn’t
really know who these people were.
Maybe a first name.
JESSE
Why were there so many bodies
washing up on the banks of the
Danube?
CELINE
I think some were from accidents on
boats and things like that, but
most of them were suicides that
jumped in the river.

I always liked the idea of all
these unknown people, lost in the
world. When I was young I always
thought that if none of your family

it’s like not really being dead.

worst for you.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - SUNSET

They are in the huge old Ferris wheel in the Prater amusement
park. They have a large box to themselves and walk around in
it looking at the various views.
CELINE
When I’m up above everyone like
this, I always think like the
entire human race is this body, and
we’re all cells in the body. It’s
an amazing, exquisite mess, no?
JESSE
Yeah...
(a beat)
I want to change the subject for a
second. This could be an important
moment. I don’t know if you
noticed, but we’re alone in this
car. The sun is going down...
(a beat)
Before the night is over, is it
safe to assume that we’re going to
kiss?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Probably.

CELINE
JESSE
CELINE

JESSE
Probably. Then I propose we jump
in time to that moment when we
would naturally do that - probably
a couple of hours from now after a
certain amount of awkwardness and
stuff - and bring that moment back
to here and now, given these ideal
surroundings. It’ll be a great way
to remember not only our first
kiss, but this great sunset, the
Ferris wheel, Vienna...
Celine walks over to him and puts her arms around his neck.
CELINE
How come every time you want me to
do something, you start talking
about time travel?

29.
JESSE
Okay, I think we should kiss right
now.
They begin kissing and the Ferris wheel keeps moving.
18

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT
Walking along, they are in mid-conversation.
CELINE
But I don’t think it matters what
generation you’re born into. Look
at my parents. They were these
angry young May ‘68 people
revolting against everything - the
government, their conservative
Catholic backgrounds. I was born
not long after and my dad went on
to become this successful architect
and we began to travel all over the
world and I was raised with all the
freedoms they had fought for. And
yet for me now, it’s another type
of fight. We still have to deal
with all the same shit. But you
can’t really know what or who the
enemy is.
JESSE
I don’t know if there is an enemy.
Everyone’s parents fucked them up.
They either left them or stuck
around and taught them the wrong
stuff. Rich kids’ parents give
them too much, poor kids’ not
enough. You either get too much
attention or not enough. My
parents are just these two people
who didn’t like each other very
much who got married and had a kid.
And they tried to be nice to me.
CELINE
Did your parents divorce?
JESSE
Yeah, finally. They should have
done it earlier, but they stuck
together for the well-being of my
sister and me. Thanks.

JESSE (CONT'D)
You know, my mom once told me,
right in front of my father when
they were in this big fight, that
he was really, really pissed off
when he found out she was pregnant
with me - that I was this big
mistake. Looking back on it, I
think that shaped the way I think.
I saw the world as this place I
wasn’t really meant to be and had
the people who created me had more
control of the situation, I
wouldn’t exist.
CELINE
But that’s so sad.
JESSE
I think I eventually found a
comfort in that. Like my life was
my own doing or something.
CELINE
My parents are still together and I
think they’re happy. But I think
it’s a healthy process to rebel
against your parents and everything
that came before. In a certain
way, more than rebelling, it’s to
have the feeling that we’re finding
a new way to deal with love, sex,
society, everything. We should
always have to reinvent and make it
our own.
They walk in silence, just taking in all around them for a
few moments. A couple walks by, but both are completely in
their own worlds.
CELINE (CONT’D)
I’ve been wondering lately...do you
know anyone who’s in a happy
relationship?
JESSE
Yeah, I know happy couples, but it
seems like they have to lie to each
other.

People can live their whole life as
a lie.

My grandmother was married to this
man, and I always thought she had a
very simple, uncomplicated love
life. But she just confessed to me
that she spent her life dreaming
about another man she was always in
love with. She just accepted her
fate. I was so sad. But I also
found it very beautiful that she
had all those emotions I never
thought she would have had.
JESSE
I guarantee you that it was better
that way. Had she got to know him,
he would have disappointed her
eventually.
CELINE
How do you know? You don’t know
who they are.
JESSE
I know. It’s just people have all
these romantic projections.
CELINE
What do you mean, Mr. Romantic up
in the Ferris wheel kiss me now as
the sun is going down...?
JESSE
(interrupting)
All right, all right. What about
your grandmother? Finish your
thought.
CELINE
It just amazed me that I’ve spent
over twenty years of my life around
her and I didn’t know her.
JESSE
You know her, but no one really
knows anyone. That’s the thing
about relationships - people are
always saying, “I want to know you,
I want to know who you are.” But
it is so hard for anyone to even
know themselves. Who I am is
always changing, so how can anyone
else share in that?

So that’s it? It’s been nice not
knowing you.
They look over and see several elderly couples riding the
bumper cars.

EXT. KLEINES CAFÉ - NIGHT

19

They are sitting at a table in a sparsely populated outdoor
café. Jesse looks around briefly and then suddenly leans
over and kisses a slightly surprised Celine.
JESSE
I just wanted to kiss you again.
Celine sort of smiles and shrugs her shoulders when a ROSE
PEDDLER suddenly approaches them. She is an older gypsylooking woman and holds up her bunch of roses toward Jesse.
ROSE PEDDLER
(in German)
You buy a rose for the young lady?
Jesse smiles and digs in his pocket.
JESSE
Sure, how many schillings?
Twenty.

ROSE PEDDLER

As Jesse hands her the coins and she gives him the rose, she
suddenly turns all her attention to Celine. She impulsively
grabs her hand and intensely starts looking at her palm.
ROSE PEDDLER (CONT’D)
You want your palm read?
Sure.

CELINE

Celine looks over at Jesse, who rolls his eyes, feeling a
little invaded. She flashes him a “I want to do this, don’t
spoil it” look.
ROSE PEDDLER
Hmmm. Uhh-huuh. So you have been
on a journey and you are a stranger
to this place. You are an
adventurer...a seeker...and
adventurer in your mind.

33.
Celine is engrossed and occasionally nods.
ROSE PEDDLER (CONT’D)
You are interested in the power of
the woman. In a woman’s deep
strength and creativity. You are
becoming this woman.
(a beat)
You need to resign yourself to the
awkwardness of life. Only if you
find peace within yourself will you
find true connections with others.
The rose peddler looks up at Jesse and gestures to him.
ROSE PEDDLER (CONT’D)
This is a stranger to you, yes?
CELINE
Well, yeah, I guess.
The rose peddler authoritatively reaches for Jesse’s hand,
which he awkwardly offers up. She examines his hand
thoroughly, flips it over, examines his thumb, and lets him
take it back.
ROSE PEDDLER

You’ll be alright

He is learning.

Okay?
Thank you.

That was good.

Celine gets up and hands the woman several coins.

As she

ROSE PEDDLER
You are both stars, don’t forget.
When the stars exploded billions of
years ago, they formed everything
that is this world. The moon, the
trees, everything we know is
stardust. So don’t forget. You
are stardust.
They walk away, and Celine is filled with the experience but
Jesse looks a little annoyed. The more he builds up to a
rant, the more amused she seems to get.

34.
JESSE
That’s all nice and everything, we
are stardust and all that, and you
are becoming this great woman, but
I hope you don’t think that’s much
different than reading your
horoscope in some syndicated daily
paper.
CELINE
Well, she knew I was on vacation
and that we didn’t know each other
and that I was going to become this
great woman.
JESSE
(interrupting)
And what was that “I am learning”
bullshit? That’s waaay
condescending - she wasn’t even
doing me, and I even bought that
fucking rose from her.
(starting rant)
If opportunists like that would
ever tell the real truth, it would
put their asses out of business.
(new thought)
Just once I want to see some old
lady save up her money, and just as
she’s about to hear all this great
stuff, the fortune teller would
say,
(wide-eyed stare)
“Tomorrow and all your remaining
days will be a lot like today, a
tedious collection of hours. You
will have no new passions, travels,
or thoughts. When you die you will
be forgotten. Two hundred
schillings, please.” That I’d like
to see.
Celine plays with him.
CELINE
So it’s funny how she almost didn’t
notice you. I loved what she said.
JESSE
Of course you do. You pay your
money, you get to hear something
that makes you feel good.

As they are walking, Celine notices a poster for an upcoming
exhibit of Seurat’s drawings.
CELINE
Oh, man, this doesn’t start until
next week - we’ll miss it.
She motions to one of the drawings on the poster.
CELINE (CONT’D)
I actually saw this one at a museum
a few years ago. I just stared and
stared at it - must have been fortyfive minutes.
Cool.

human figures always seem so
transitory.

As they walk down the street, they wander up the steps to a
large cathedral. They check to see if the door is open. It
is, and they go inside.

INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

They enter to find it completely empty but with hundreds of
candles still burning. In the background we hear the sound
of the organ being tuned.
JESSE
Too bad it isn’t daytime so we
could see the stained glass windows
better.

36.
CELINE
I was in an old church like this
one with my grandmother in Budapest
a few days ago. Even though I
reject most of the religious thing,
I can’t help but feeling for all
those people that come here lost,
or in pain, guilt - who come here
looking for answers. It fascinates
me how a single place can join so
much pain and happiness, for so
many generations.
JESSE
So you’re pretty close to your
grandmother.
CELINE
Yes, I think so. I think it’s
because I’ve always had this
feeling that I’m this very old
woman, laying down, about to die,
and her last thoughts are the
remembrance of her youth and her
life. I feel like my life is just
her memories or something.
JESSE
That’s wild. I always feel like
I’m still this thirteen-year-old
boy who doesn’t really know how to
be an adult. So it’s like I’m
pretending to live a life, taking
notes for when I’ll really have to
do it. Kind of like a dress
rehearsal for a junior high play.
CELINE
That’s funny. So up there in the
Ferris wheel it was this very old
woman kissing this very young boy.
JESSE
Get your head out of the gutter.
(new thought)
Do you know anything about the
Quakers?
CELINE
No, not much.

37.
JESSE
It’s really cool. I went to this
Quaker wedding once, and do you
know how they do it? The couple
kneels down in the middle of the
church in front of everyone, and
they stare at each other. Nobody
speaks unless God moves them to say
something - a blessing, a warning,
nothing, whatever. And then after
an hour of staring into each
other’s eyes, they’re married.
CELINE
That’s beautiful.

I like that.

They stare at each other for an extended moment.

He suddenly

JESSE
Gosh, this is kind of a horrible
story, but maybe this is an
appropriate place to tell it. I
was driving around with this buddy
of mine who’s this big atheist, and
we came to a stop where there was
this homeless guy holding up a sign
saying he needed a job or
something. My friend holds out a
hundred-dollar bill to him and
asks, “Do you believe in God?” The
guy looks at him, looks at the
money, and says, “Yes, I do.” My
friend goes, “Wrong answer,” and
drives away.

No, not yet. And what would you be
doing?
JESSE
I don’t know - hanging out at the
airport, reading old magazines,
crying in my coffee because you
wouldn’t get off the train with me.
Ahh...

She gives him a little kiss.
CELINE (CONT’D)
Actually, I’d probably have gotten
off the train in Salzburg with
someone else.
JESSE
Yeah, yeah. I’m just that American
decorating your blank canvas.
No, no.

CELINE
I’m having a great time.

Really?

JESSE
Me too.

CELINE
I’m glad. I love this because no
one knows I’m here and I don’t know
anyone that knows you that would
tell me all the bad things you’ve
done.
JESSE
I can tell you some.
CELINE
I’m sure. You hear so much shit
about people. When I start dating
a guy, I always feel like a general
in the army - you know, plotting my
strategy and maneuverings, knowing
his weak points, what would hurt
him, seduce him...
(a beat)
But if we were around each other
all the time, what would be the
first thing about me that would
drive you crazy?

39.
JESSE
I don’t want to answer that. I
dated this girl once who used to
always ask me that. Finally, I
told her that I thought that she
didn’t handle criticism very well.
Then she flew into a rage and broke
up with me. But I think she really
just wanted the chance to say what
she thought was wrong with me. So
just tell me what it is about me
that bugs you.
CELINE
No, there’s nothing.
Tell me.

JESSE
C’mon, what?

CELINE
I can’t think of anything.
JESSE
I’m demanding you say something.
CELINE
Actually, if I think about it, I
didn’t like this kind of behavior
back at the palm reader. You were
like this little rooster prick.

Rooster prick? What the hell is
that?

Yes, you were like this little
child whining because all the
attention wasn’t focused on him.
JESSE
What are you talking about?
woman robs you blind...

You were acting like a little boy
walking by an ice cream shop,
crying because his mother wouldn’t
buy him a milk shake or something.

this flower-peddling charlatan had
to say about anything.

40.
A man, the HOMELESS POET, approaches them.
HOMELESS POET
(in German)
I’d like to ask you something.
CELINE
Uh, I speak okay, but he doesn’t at
all.
HOMELESS POET
(in English)
Okay, then. I’d like to make a
deal with you guys. Instead of
just asking for money, I’ll ask you
for a word. I will then write a
poem in which that word will be
used. I’ll write it in English.
If you like it, if you feel it adds
something to your life in any way,
then you can pay me whatever you
feel like.
CELINE AND JESSE
Okay, it’s a deal.
HOMELESS POET
Pick a word.
JESSE
Uhh...
(to Celine)
What word?
CELINE
Milk shake.
Jesse flashes her a look.
JESSE
I was going to say “rooster prick.”
But perfect, of course, milk shake.
The poet walks off a ways and starts writing.
CELINE
I like what he said about adding
something to your life.
JESSE
I know. Hey, were we just arguing
back there?

41.

No, no...

CELINE

JESSE
Yeah, I think we were.
CELINE
Even if we were, why does everyone
think conflict is so bad? Good
things can come out of conflict.
JESSE
I guess so. I think if I could
just accept the fact that life is
supposed to be difficult, and
that’s what’s to be expected, then
I wouldn’t get so pissed off about
it. I’d just be happy when
something nice happened.
CELINE
I think That’s why I’m still in
school. It’s easier to have
something to fight against.
JESSE
And we’ve all had this
competitiveness drilled into us.
(thinking)
I mean, I can be doing the most
nothing thing - shooting pool or
playing darts socially - and I’ll
feel it come over me: I want to
win, I want to do the best I can,
and my standards suddenly shift to
just beyond my abilities. I can
hear every coach or male teacher or
boss I ever had. “Jesse, you’re
not trying hard enough! Get your
head out of your ass! Hustle up!”
CELINE
Is that why you tried to get me off
the train? Competitiveness?
JESSE
What do you mean?
CELINE
To make sure the guy behind you
didn’t pick me up? Where you
competing with him?

42.

What guy?

JESSE

CELINE
That really cute, big, strong,
Italian-looking guy two seats
behind you that was smiling at me
the whole time.
JESSE
He’s better-looking than me?
The homeless poet returns with a small piece of paper.

C’est la vie.

Will you read it to us?

Sure.

They give him some money.
JESSE
Thanks, man. Good luck.
CELINE
It’s beautiful, no?
JESSE
Yeah, that was beautiful. You
know, he didn’t just write that
poem...I’m not saying he didn’t
write that poem. He just didn’t
write it tonight. He just plugged
in that milk shake.

you consider me detached?

JESSE
Detached from what?
CELINE
Someone once called me this
detached intellectual. I’m afraid
I am like that. I comment too much
on thing and maybe don’t feel close
enough to anything.
JESSE
I don’t feel that way about you at
all. Whoever said that is an
asshole.

44.
CELINE
No, but it’s my biggest fear. To
be one of those people with that
sort of academic, liberal, detached
view of everything. That whole
attitude has nothing to do with
really living.
JESSE
Who’s to say what’s really living?
CELINE
Well, I wonder. That’s the big
question, no? I think it’s either
a life experienced or a life
examined. But life examined is
life experienced.
(a beat)
Maybe if I had none of these stupid
artistic pretensions at all, I
would be looking at the world
differently.
JESSE
I know what you mean.
CELINE
What’s that Thomas Mann quote? “I
would rather participate in life
than write a hundred stories.”
JESSE
Hmmm, I like that.
(a beat)
I knew this guy once, this kind of
nerdy goth-rock guy. And he was
crossing the street one day, and he
got hit by a car. We all went to
see him in the hospital, and he was
going to be okay and everything,
but he told us that his strongest
sensation from the accident was the
joy he felt when he realized that
finally something was actually
happening to him.
They both laugh.
CELINE
Yeah, it’s like seeing yourself
from a third-person perspective. I
always feel like I’m observing my
life instead of living it.

was too busy observing them; each
of them was like a paragraph of a
book I might write someday,
describing every emotion in detail.
JESSE
I know. I remember when I was
younger listening to my parents
fight and feeling like I was in an
after-school special on TV.
Thinking I should act moody, or
depressed. I should steal some
cigarettes and sunglasses, get
caught, and then blame it on the
fact that I come from a troubled
home.
CELINE
Yeah, I think I’m always so much
more happy with books and movies
and stuff. I think I get more
excited about well-done
representations of life than life
itself.

EXT. HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT

They walk up to Viennese hot dog stand and order something to
drink. They notice some of the interesting characters
hanging around, including the man behind the corner.
27

INT. CAFÉ - NIGHT

27

They enter an interesting old café. Celine goes to the
bathroom while Jesse waits. Separated from her for the first
time, he stands around a bit awkwardly, observing posters and
the goings-on in the café. She eventually returns and they
exit the café.

EXT. ARENA CLUB - NIGHT
They walk in front of a bar/club from which there is music
coming out.
JESSE
You want to go in?

Yeah.

Is there a cover?

JESSE
It’s cheap. I’ll pay.

Don’t worry about it.

INT. ARENA CLUB - NIGHT

29

A SINGER with a guitar is onstage finishing up a weird but
humorous song. He finishes and gets up to leave.
SINGER
(in German)
Hey, um, stick around. I think Liz
is going to show her latest film
and provide some verbal
accompaniment.
A projector is set up to show against the back wall of the
stage. The filmmaker, LIZ, takes the microphone and sits on
the stage facing the screen. She has a piece of paper in her
hand and signals for the projectionist to start. The room
darkens and the film begins. Behind the first black-andwhite Super 8 images is the title scratched in white, in
German: A KIND OF NOISE AND A KIND OF SILENCE. The film
consists of images of fairly recent (1985-1994) events, bands
playing, catastrophes, televised images. Interspersed
throughout is an eerie series of images of solitary
individuals, some looking at the camera, some away. The film
evokes a melancholy and almost romantic loneliness. She
speaks in German and we read subtitles.
LIZ
Our critique began, as all
critiques begin, with doubt...doubt
became our life. Ours was a quest
for a new story, our own, and we
grasped toward this new history,
driven by the Dada suspicion that
ordinary language could not tell
it.
(a beat)
Our past appeared frozen in the
distance and our every gesture and
accent bespoke the negation of an
old world and the reach for a new
one.
(a beat)
(MORE)

47.
LIZ (CONT'D)
The discovery of a true
communication was what it was about
- or at least the quest for such a
communication, the adventure of
finding it and losing it...we
continued looking, the unappeased
and the unaccepting, beneath,
outside, dispersed, communicating
only by a passing glance but still
knowing that no matter how empty
the world seemed, no matter how
degraded and used up the world
appeared to be, anything was still
possible.
Scratched on the film for a closing credit: TO BEGIN AGAIN,
FROM THE BEGINNING.

INT. BAR INSIDE THE ARENA COMPOUND - NIGHT
They are taking turns playing pinball.
JESSE
So, we haven’t even talked about
this, but, uh, are you dating
anyone? You got a boyfriend
waiting for you in Paris or
anything like that?
CELINE
No, no, not right now...
You did?

JESSE

CELINE
We broke up over six months ago.
JESSE
I’m sorry. I mean, I’m not that
sorry, but, uh, tell me about it.
CELINE
No, no, it’s boring.

I can’t

JESSE
C’mon, c’mon.
CELINE
I was really disappointed. I
thought this one would last a
while.

CELINE (CONT'D)
He was very stupid, ugly, bad in
bed, alcoholic - I was kind of
giving him a favor. But he left me
saying I loved him too much and
because I was blocking his artistic
expression. I was traumatized and
became totally obsessed with him.
I went to see a shrink and it came
up that I had written these little
stories about how I was going to
kill him - all the intricate
details about how I would do it and
not get caught.
Kill him?

JESSE

She realizes Jesse is looking at her a bit strangely.
CELINE
Oh no, it’s nothing I would ever
do, I think it was just some
writing.
JESSE
I understand.
CELINE
Anyway, but this stupid shrink
believed everything I was telling
her. She said she had to call the
police. She was totally convinced
I was really going to do it even
though I told her it was just my
way of dealing with it. She said,
looking deep into my eyes, “The way
you said it, I know you are going
to do it.” That was my first and
last session. I totally got over
him, but now I’m obsessed that he’s
going to die from an accident,
maybe a thousand kilometers away,
and I will be accused.
Jesse just smiles.

They change positions and she begins

CELINE (CONT’D)
Why is it you become obsessed with
the people you don’t really care
for?
(a beat)
So, what about you? Are you with
anyone?

49.
JESSE
Funny, how we avoided this question
for so long.
CELINE
I know, but now you have to tell
me.
JESSE
I don’t know. Love is like this
escape for people who haven’t
learned to be alone or to make
something of themselves. People
think love is this unselfish or
totally giving thing. But if you
think about it, there’s probably
nothing more selfish.
CELINE
So who just broke up with you?
What?

JESSE

CELINE
Sounds like you just got hurt.
JESSE
Okay...big confession.
(a beat)
Actually, I’ll tell you something.
I didn’t just come to Europe to
find myself and read Hemingway in
Paris and shit like that. I worked
all spring saving up money to fly
to Madrid to spend the summer with
my girlfriend, who’s been on this
asinine art history program for the
last year. But I got over here,
and on our first night, reunited at
long last, we went out to dinner,
with five of her friends: Gonzalo,
Pedro, Maria, Antonio, Suzie from
home. She pretty much avoided
being alone with me the first
couple of days I was there, but I
stuck around awhile just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn’t
come. So I got the cheapest
charter flight out of Europe, this
one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow,
but I had a couple of weeks to
kill, so I bought a Eurail pass.
(a beat)
(MORE)

50.
JESSE (CONT'D)
You know what the worst thing about
someone breaking up with you is?
Remembering how little you really
thought about the people you broke
up with and realizing that’s how
little they’re thinking about you.
You like to think you are both in
so much pain, but really they’re
just relieved you’re gone.
CELINE
Well, you should look at bright
colors.
What?

JESSE

CELINE
That’s what that shrink told me. I
was paying nine hundred francs an
hour to hear that I was a homicidal
maniac but I could perhaps shift my
obsession if I would concentrate on
bright colors.
JESSE
Did it work?
CELINE
I haven’t killed him yet.
31

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

31

Walking along, they are engaged in an upbeat, lively debate.
JESSE
I mean, why is a man ultimately
judged so harshly on the issue of
fidelity? You can be the best
father and husband, you can be
supportive and a great friend to
your wife, but if you fuck around uh-oh, we had it all wrong, you’re
really a loser. I mean, there are
these breeds of monkeys, and all
they do is have sex all the time.
And they’re the ones that are the
most peaceful and the most happy.
What’s so bad about fooling around?
CELINE
You’re talking about monkeys?

51.

Yeah.

JESSE

CELINE
Sounds like a perfect male argument
for justifying them fooling around.
JESSE
But the women monkeys are fooling
around too.
CELINE
You know, I had this awful paranoid
thought that feminism was mostly
invented by men so they could fuck
around more. Women, free your
mind, free your body, sleep with
me, we’re all free and happy as
long as I can fool around as much
as I want...
JESSE
But think about it. If you had an
island with ninety-nine women and
one man, within a year you’d have
the possibility of ninety-nine
babies. If you had an island with
ninety-nine men and one woman,
after a year you’d have the
possibility of one baby.
CELINE
Yes, and there’d probably be only
about forty-three men left because
they would have killed each other.
And on the other island there would
be ninety-nine women, ninety-nine
babies, and no man because all the
women would have gotten together
and eaten him alive.
JESSE
There’s something to that, isn’t
there? I think women don’t mind
killing men on some level. Like, I
was walking down the street once
with my ex-girlfriend, and we pass
these four thuggy guys leaning on a
Camaro, and sure enough, one says,
“Hey babe, nice ass.” I keep
walking and I think, okay, have
your fun, is it that big a deal? I
don’t do anything. I let it
slide...

52.
CELINE
Plus there were four of them.
JESSE
Exactly. So a few steps later, she
turns and says, “Fuck you,
dickheads.” I’m thinking, wait a
minute, they aren’t going to come
over and kick her ass. Who’s just
been pushed to the front of the
line on this one? See, women say
they hate it when you get all
territorial and protective, but
when it suits them, they tell you
you’re being all unmanly and a
wimp.
CELINE
But I don’t think women want to
kill men, and if they do, they
rarely succeed. I’m sure men kill
more women. Anyway, this is
depressing. You know what?
JESSE
Let’s stop talking about this.
CELINE
Yeah. When you start talking about
women and men, there’s no end.
I know

INT. CAFÉ - NIGHT

32

After a series of tables of interesting people and hearing
bits of conversations, we see Celine and Jesse sitting across
from each other, talking for once.
CELINE
Okay. Now I’m calling my best
friend in Paris, who I’m supposed
to have lunch with in about eight
hours. Drrr! Drrr! Ring! Ring!
Pick up.

53.

What?

JESSE

CELINE
Pick up the phone.
Oh, right.

JESSE
Hello?

CELINE
Allo, Vani. C’est Celine.
ça va?

Comment

JESSE
Bien, et toi?
CELINE
Oh, tu sais ce qui n’est arrivé...
JESSE
Okay, maybe we should do it in
English.
CELINE
Vanessa. I’m sorry I missed lunch,
but I met a guy on the train and
got off with him in Vienna. We’re
still here.
JESSE
Are you crazy?
Probably.

CELINE

JESSE
So he’s Austrian?

He lives there?

CELINE
No, no, he’s just passing through
here too. He’s American. He goes
home tomorrow morning.
JESSE
So why’d you get off the train with
him?
CELINE
He convinced me, but I think I was
ready after only talking to him a
short while. He was so sweet.
(MORE)

54.
CELINE (CONT'D)
We were in the lounge car and he
began to talk about him as a little
boy seeing his great-grandmother’s
ghost. I think that’s when I feel
for him - just the idea of this
little boy, full of dreams. He
trapped me.
Hmmm.

JESSE

CELINE
And he’s so cute. He has really
beautiful blue eyes, nice pink
lips, and greasy hair. He’s kinda
tall and a little clumsy. I like
to feel his eyes on me when I look
away. And he kind of kisses like
an adolescent. It’s so cute.
What?

JESSE

CELINE
Yeah, we kissed. It was so
adorable. As the night went on I
began to like him more and more.
But I’m afraid he’s scared of me.
I told him of my story about the
woman killing her ex-boyfriend and
stuff. He must be thinking I’m
this manipulative, mean, dangerous
woman. I just hope he doesn’t feel
that way about me because - you
know me - I’m the most harmless
person. I just hide behind
angriness because it’s the only way
I’ve found to protect myself. The
only person I could ever really
hurt is myself.
JESSE
I’m sure he’s not scared of you.
I’m sure he’s crazy about you.
CELINE
Okay, now it’s your turn.
your friend.

Call

Jesse puts the phone up to his ear.
JESSE
Brrriiing. I usually get this
guy’s answering machine.

55.
CELINE
Hey, dude, what’s up?
JESSE
Hey, Frank, you’re there.
CELINE
So you’re back? How was Madrid?
JESSE
Well, it all pretty much sucked.
I’m coming back a little early.
Jodie and I finally had our long
overdue meltdown. The long
distance thing never seems to work,
does it? All my stupid, romantic
projections. Ugh. I was actually
only in Madrid a few days. I had
to get the hell out of there. I’ve
been wandering around Europe for
the last couple of weeks like an
idiot. I got a cheaper flight out
of Vienna that didn’t leave for a
while, but it really wasn’t that
much cheaper. I could have come
right back, but I just couldn’t. I
think I wanted to just wallow for a
while. I wanted to run, but not
home. I didn’t want to see anyone
I knew. I didn’t want to talk. I
wanted to be a ghost, completely
anonymous.
CELINE
Are you okay?
JESSE
Yeah, that’s just it. I’m
great...rapturous. I’m a real
person again. I’ll tell you why.
It’s my last night in Europe and
I’ve met someone very special. You
know how they say we are each
other’s angels and demons? Well,
she was literally this Botticelli
angel, waiting for me at the gate
back to life.
CELINE
Wow...how did you meet?

56.
JESSE
On the train. I actually saw her a
couple of hours before we ever
talked, as I was finding a seat.
She had her foot up on the seat
across from her and didn’t notice
me at all as I passed by her. Then
later, there was this weirdo couple
fighting near her, and she moved
back and happened to sit right
across the aisle from me. We began
to talk. I don’t think she really
liked me at the beginning. She is
so smart and passionate and
beautiful - I felt so unsure of
myself. I felt everything I was
saying was stupid macho stuff.
CELINE
Oh, man, I wouldn’t worry. I’m
sure she was not judging you. And
by the way, she decided to sit next
to you. I’m sure she did it on
purpose. Us men are stupid. We
never understand women. They act
strange, the little I know of them.
33

EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - NIGHT

33

Celine and Jesse sit on the steps of a statue and observe the
fairly constant activity around them. A serious-looking guy
walks by carrying a bag.
JESSE
See that guy? We’ll never see him
again. That was the one moment our
lives intersect.
The guy suddenly turns and walks back the other way.
CELINE
I always wonder about things like
that. Like, think of the bag he is
carrying. I wonder what is in it.
If you think he’s carrying a bomb
to blow up the opera because he
failed his audition for Don Juan,
then his serious expression becomes
this angry, vicious face.
(MORE)

57.
CELINE (CONT'D)
But if you imagine in his bag is a
present for his young, dying wife,
then he becomes this poor,
sympathetic character who you want
to give a big hug to.
Hmmm.

JESSE

Celine indicates a young art-student-looking woman.
CELINE
She’s thinking about a TV show she
saw yesterday on strippers, and
even though all her friends were
disgusted by it, she’s thinking
about giving up her low-paying
office job and giving it a try.
A nerdy guy walks by.
JESSE
That guy over there...rejected by
Scientology. Actually flunked his
free personality test - they had no
use for him.
34

EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - NIGHT
They sit on the ledge overlooking the lit-up opera house.
JESSE
I feel like this is some dream
world we’re walking through.
CELINE
It’s so weird. It’s like our time
together is just ours - it’s our
own creation. It’s like, I’m in
your dream and you’re in mine.
JESSE
Yeah, what we’re doing this whole
night shouldn’t officially be
happening.
CELINE
Maybe that’s why this feels so
other-worldly.
(a beat)
But then, the morning comes and we
turn into pumpkins.

34

58.
JESSE
Ahh. I don’t want to talk about
the morning.
CELINE
But at this point I think you’re
supposed to produce the glass
slipper and see if it fits.
They both laugh.
35

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

35

They are on a large docked boat, the Johann Strauss, that
serves as a restaurant. They are sitting at a quiet outdoor
table on the bow of the boat.
JESSE
And this older friend of mine said,
at the birth of his child - it was
a home birth and he was there
helping out and everything - at
that profound moment of birth, all
he could think about was death.
That he was seeing something
experience life for the first time,
struggling for breath, and knowing
that it was going to die someday.
He couldn’t get it out of his head.
CELINE
I think that’s why life is so
interesting - because it’s going to
end.
I know.
alive.

JESSE
Death ups the ante being

CELINE
It’s the same for us tonight,
though. If we knew we were going
to see each other next week, it
would not be the same energy, no?
JESSE
Yeah, I know.
CELINE
Do you think we will see each other
after tomorrow morning?

59.
JESSE
I don’t know. What do you think?
CELINE
I asked you.
JESSE
Hmmm. I’m thinking how...I don’t
know if I’m going to be in Europe
again anytime soon. Are you coming
to the U.S. For any reason?
Celine puts her head down on the table, depressed.
CELINE
Oh, God, I don’t want to get into
the practical side of how we’d see
each other again. Flying. Let’s
be rational adults about this.
JESSE
Okay, uh, rational.
CELINE
We should try something different.
(a beat)
It’s not so bad if tonight is our
only night. Maybe it makes it
really special.
JESSE
Yeah, usually you exchange numbers
and call each other once, maybe
write each other once or twice...
CELINE
And then the slow fizzle.
JESSE
I hate that.
CELINE
There was this famous writer - I
don’t remember who - who said the
ideal relationship was two intense
years, with clean breaks, fresh
starts, friends for life, something
like that. It’s like if you knew
your relationship had to end in two
years, there would be no room for
fighting or wasted time. There
could be more love and appreciation
for one another.
(MORE)

60.
CELINE (CONT'D)
It’s like, if everyone you met you
knew was going to die at midnight,
you would be a much more
compassionate person. I mean,
everyone’s going to die, but since
no one knows when, there’s all the
time in the world to be assholes to
one another.
JESSE
Why do we think that relationships
are supposed to last forever
anyway, and that anything less is a
failure?
(a beat)
But I hate the thought that we’re
just these ships passing in the
night. I think the only time I get
depressed is when I feel that life
is just this series of momentary
connections. I mean, of all the
people you’ve ever known, how many
of them are still in your life in
any way? What happened to all the
people you grew up with? Miss Van
Sickle, my bus driver in first
grade - what’s she up to? What
kind of life is she having?
A wandering violin player has entered the room and is playing
a waltz.
CELINE
But for some people, there are no
real good-byes. I think if you
have a meaningful experience with
someone else, a true communication,
they are with you forever in a way.
We are all a part of each other in
ways we’ll never know.
JESSE
So it’s a deal? We’ll die in the
morning?
CELINE
I think it’s the only way. I don’t
want to cheapen what’s special
about our time together. If we
push for something more, it’s like
we’re trying to commodify ourselves
or something.

61.
JESSE
Okay, no delusions. No
projections. Let’s just make the
rest of tonight great.
CELINE
And it’ll be ours forever.
JESSE
We should do some kind of special
handshake or something.
Okay.

CELINE

They do a sort of handshake and then watch the violin player.
36

EXT. ACTIVE STREET - NIGHT

36

Celine and Jesse walk down a fairly busy street near some
nightclubs. They come across a crowd gathered around a woman
dancing, and the rhythmic sound of finger cymbals can be
heard. Sitting on the ground is a man playing a dumbek who
beats out a mesmerizing rhythm. Celine grabs Jesse’s arm
with a look of excitement and rushes toward the crowd,
finding a good vantage point to watch the Middle Eastern
dancer. The dancer performs in an exciting and unusual way
and elicits a positive reaction from the crowd. At the end
of the performance Celine places a couple of bills in the
tambourine that sits on the sidewalk near the dancer’s shoes.
Then she and Jesse proceed down the street as the crowd
disperses. Celine is obviously moved by the dance.
CELINE
I saw a documentary on that stuff It’s a birth dance.
JESSE
A birth dance? How does that work?
CELINE
Women used it when giving birth.
In some parts of the world they
still do it. The woman in labor
enters a tent and the women of her
tribe surround her and dance using
their torsos and pelvises, and they
encourage the birthing woman to
dance with them so as to make the
birth less painful. And after the
baby is born, they all dance in
celebration.

62.
JESSE
Wow. My mom would have never gone
for that.
CELINE
But it’s a really primal dance.
They think that women have usually
done it mainly for other women as
some kind of fertility ritual.
JESSE
That’s cool.
CELINE
It’s a beautiful thing. I like the
idea of dance as being a common
function of life, something that
everyone participates in.
JESSE
I know. I heard about this old man
watching a bunch of young people
dancing. He said, “How beautiful.
They are trying to shake off their
genitals and become angels.”
(a beat)
But, uh, just one question back
there. When the women are being
all spiritual and dancing for the
gods and themselves and stuff,
where are the men? Out food
gathering? Just not allowed? See,
Y’all don’t need us?
CELINE
Men are lucky we don’t bite off
their heads after mating. Certain
insects do that, you know - spiders
and stuff. We, at least, let you
live. What are you complaining
about?
She laughs as he jumps on her words.
JESSE
You’re officially kidding, but you
keep bringing that up. There is
something to that.
CELINE
(interrupting)
No, no, no. Okay, speaking
seriously here.
(MORE)

63.
CELINE (CONT'D)
I mean, I feel this pressure to be
a strong and independent icon of
womanhood and not have it look like
my life is only revolving around
some guy, but the love of a man and
returning that love means a lot to
me. I always make fun of it and
stuff, but isn’t everything we’re
doing in life a way to be loved a
little more or something?
JESSE
Sometimes I dream of being a good
father and a good husband.
Sometimes that feels really close,
but other times it just seems
silly, and that it would ruin my
life. It’s not that I have a fear
of commitment or I’m incapable of
loving or caring about someone
else, because I can. It’s just
that if I’m totally honest with
myself, I’d rather die knowing that
I was really good at something,
that I was special or had excelled
in some way, than to have only been
in a really nice, caring
relationship.
CELINE
You know, I had worked for this
older man, and once he told me that
he had spent all his life thinking
about his career and his work, and
how he was fifty-two and it
suddenly struck him that he had
never really given anything of
himself, that his life was for no
one and nothing. He was almost
crying saying this.
(a beat)
I really believe that if there’s
any kind of god, he wouldn’t be in
any one of us - not you, not me but just this space in between. If
there’s some magic in this world,
it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone else, sharing
something, even if it’s almost
impossible to succeed. But who
cares - the answer must be in the
attempt.

64.
37

INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

37

They enter a small, almost desolate disco where on couple is
dancing and a few others are sitting around - the up-allnight crowd. They split up and he goes over to the BARTENDER
and starts talking to him, pleading with him. She goes over
to an empty table and subtly takes two glasses. Across the
room, he’s made a little headway with the gruff, older
bartender, who eventually relents and hands him a bottle of
wine. Suddenly Lou Christie’s “Lightnin’ Strikes” comes over
the speakers and Jesse hams it up as he crosses the dance
floor on his way back to meet her at the door. He tries to
get into it and has a little success.
38

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

38

Later, they are sitting in a remote area of the park, pouring
glasses from their bottle of wine.
CELINE
So often in my life I’ve been with
people and shared beautiful moments
like traveling or staying up all
night and watching the sunrise, and
I knew it was a special moment, but
something was always wrong. I
wished I’d been with someone else.
I knew that what I was feeling exactly what was so important to me
- they didn’t understand. But I’m
happy to be with you. You couldn’t
possibly know why a night like this
is so important to my life right
now, but it is. I think this is a
great morning.
JESSE
It is a great morning.
(a beat)
Do you think we’d have other
mornings like this?
CELINE
What about our vow?
JESSE
Yeah, I know.
(a beat)
I’ve had those same feelings of
wishing someone wasn’t there, but I
think it’s myself I’d like to get
away from.

65.
She looks up at him.
JESSE (CONT’D)
I’ve never been anywhere I haven’t
been. I’ve never had a kiss when I
wasn’t one of the kissers. I’ve
never been to the movies when I
wasn’t in the audience or gone out
bowling when I wasn’t around making
some stupid joke.
She smiles, not really taking him seriously.
JESSE (CONT’D)
No, really, I think that’s why so
many people hate themselves. I
mean if we got married, after a few
years, you’d hate a lot of my
mannerisms, the way I drink a
little too much when I’m insecure,
the way I tell the same ridiculous,
pseudo-intellectual ideas to every
couple we have over to dinner. But
you see, I’ve already heard all my
stupid stories, so of course I’m
sick of myself. But our time here
has been completely out of time.
Being with you has made me feel
like I am someone else. I haven’t
had my past around to constantly
drown me. The only other way to
lose yourself like this is with
drugs, or alcohol, dancing...stuff
like that.
Fucking...

CELINE

He just looks up at her, smiling, a little surprised.
JESSE
Yeah, fucking.
CELINE
Do you know what I want?
What?

JESSE

CELINE
To be kisses.
JESSE
I can do that.

66.
He gets up and kisses her, and tries to take it a little
further.
CELINE
I have to say something stupid.
Sure.

JESSE

CELINE
It’s very stupid.
Okay.

JESSE

CELINE
I don’t think we should sleep
together. I want to, but since
we’re not going to see each other
again, it’ll make me feel bad.
I’ll wonder who else you’re with.
I’ll miss you. I know it’s not
very adult...maybe it’s a female
thing...I can’t help it.
JESSE
Okay, we’ll see each other again.
CELINE
No. I don’t want you to break our
vow just so you can get laid.
JESSE
I don’t want to just get laid. I
want to have sex with you. We’re
going to die in the morning, right?
I think we should.
CELINE
No. Then it’s like some male
fantasy - meet a French girl on a
train, fuck her, never see her
again, and have a great story to
tell. I don’t want to be a great
story. I don’t want our great
evening to have just been for that.
JESSE
Okay, let’s not have sex.
CELINE
You don’t want to see me again?

67.
JESSE
No, of course I do. I mean, fuck,
if I was asked right now to marry
you or never see you again, I would
marry you. I mean, maybe that’s a
lot of romantic crap. But people
have gotten married for a lot less.
I think we’d have as good a chance
as anyone else. Do you want to
sleep with me?
CELINE
Well, actually I already decided to
sleep with you when I got off the
train. Now that we’ve talked so
much I don’t know anymore. Why do
I make everything so complicated?
JESSE
I don’t know.
They begin making out as we see the first light in the sky.
39

EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

39

They are walking along slowly, awkwardly, each a little in
their own world.
JESSE
What’s the first thing you’re going
to do when you get back to Paris?
CELINE
Call my parents. What about you?
JESSE
I will go pick up my dog.
with a buddy of mine.
Ahh.

He’s

CELINE
I love dogs.

JESSE
Oh, shit - we’re back in real time.
CELINE
It’s awful. I can’t stand it.
For the last few moments we’ve been hearing the sound of a
harpsichord far in the distance.
JESSE
Do you hear that?

68.
CELINE
Yeah...What is that...a
harpsichord?
JESSE
Let’s go see where the hell that’s
coming from.
They walk toward the baroque sounds. As they get closer, the
music gets louder. They finally pinpoint the source.
Through a small street-level window they see a guy in a
basement room playing away at his harpsichord. The
HARPSICHORD PLAYER’s entire room is decorated in a
seventeenth-to eightenth-century fashion with wood-plank
floors, old furniture, and paintings. Together with the
beautiful and intense music, it is a stunning view - a living
portrait. They sort of look at each other occasionally but
say nothing. Celine and Jesse both begin to feel awkward at
their Peeping Tom status now that the music is over, and they
walk off quietly. Jesse takes her hand.
JESSE (CONT’D)
Can you dance to a harpsichord?
CELINE
I don’t know. Maybe.
They dance a little on the sidewalk.
40

EXT. ALBERTINA LEDGE - EARLY MORNING

40

They sit with their heads back on a bench, staring up at the
early-morning clouds.
CELINE
When you talked earlier about after
a few years how a couple would
begin to hate each other by
anticipating their reactions or
getting tired of their mannerisms,
I think it would be the opposite
with me. I think I can fall in
love when I know everything about
him - how he’s going to part his
hair, or what shirt he’s going to
wear that day, knowing the exact
story he would tell in a given
situation. I’m sure that’s when
I’d know I’m really in love.
Jesse just smiles, looks at her, and then slowly looks back
up at the sky.

69.
JESSE
(silly voice)
The years shall run like rabbits...
What?

CELINE

JESSE
Nothing. I have this great
recording of Dylan Thomas reading
this W.H. Auden poem. He has this
great voice. It was like...
(silly voice)
“But all the clocks in the city
Began to whirr and chime:
O let not Time deceive you,
You cannot conquer Time...
“In headaches and in worry
Vaguely life leaks away,
And Time will have his fancy
To-morrow or to-day.”
41

EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAWN
She has retrieved her bag from the locker, and they are
walking along the train toward her car. They seem
vulnerable, even shy, as they both finally face the
inevitable.
CELINE
So you know what bus you’re taking
to the airport?
JESSE
Yeah, no problem.
CELINE
I guess this is it, no?
Yep.

JESSE
I really...you know.

CELINE
I know. Me too.
(a beat)
You lied to me, you know.
JESSE
What do you mean?

41

70.
CELINE
You told me that our time together
would someday make me happier with
my future husband, but now I’ll
wonder even more.
Neither says anything for an extended moment.
CELINE (CONT’D)
Be happy, okay? Work hard and have
fun with everything you’re doing.
JESSE
I will. And good luck with school
and everything.
(a beat)
I hate this.
CELINE
I know. I think the train is about
to leave.
They look into each other’s eyes. Jesse reaches out for
Celine’s hand and clasps it tightly. They smile, knowing
that they’ve changed in unexpected ways, and then embrace
tenderly for several moments. They part, and Celine turns
suddenly and walks up the stairs to her train car. As she
reaches the top step she hesitates, turns, and looks back and
Jesse, who’s still staring at her. He signals for her to
hold on a second.
JESSE
Hey, everything we were saying is
bullshit. This is all stupid - I
don’t want to do it.
She laughs.
JESSE (CONT’D)
And I didn’t lie to you. I’ll
prove it.
Yeah?

CELINE

JESSE
I’ll come with you.
Celine is almost laughing.
CELINE
No. You’ll drive me crazy. You
don’t speak French. I’d have to
completely take care of you.
(MORE)

71.
CELINE (CONT'D)
It would be a big mistake.
(a beat)
But perhaps we should meet in five
years.
JESSE
Yeah, think so? Five years?
CELINE
No, no. Five years is too long.
It would be more like a sociology
experiment. How about one year?
JESSE
Yes, one year. One year?
about six months?

How

CELINE
But it will be freezing.
JESSE
Okay, we can meet here and then go
somewhere else.
CELINE
Okay. But is that six months from
now or last night?
JESSE
Last night. Okay. Six months from
last night. December sixteenth,
six o’clock in the evening, track
eleven. It’s a train ride for you,
but I got to fly over. But, hey,
I’ll be here.
CELINE
Good. And we’re not going to write
or call or anything right?
Right.

JESSE
But six months.

They laugh at themselves and give a quick kiss before
parting.
Good-bye.
Bye.

CELINE
JESSE

They part and Celine disappears into the train.

INT/EXT. MORNING MONTAGE

42

Celine finds her way to a seat. Jesse gets his stuff out of
his locker and begins walking. As her train slowly pulls out
of the station, we hear the harpsichord and see a series of
shots of many of the locations Celine and Jesse inhabited the
night before. In the early-morning light these places are
now somehow different. Even though there is little human
presence at this time of the morning, the transformation has
begun. We see Jesse getting situated on his bus to the
airport. We then see the park where they danced, sang, and
stared up at the sky. A very old lady walks slowly across
the grass. Celine is settled on the train and reading. She
looks up from her book and just stares out the window at the
landscape going by.

FADE OUT.
